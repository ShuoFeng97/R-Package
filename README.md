Package Description This package contains function to implement different interative algorithms

Aim of these package is to investigate the performance of different conputational algorithms on computation time and estimation accuracy. Functions in this package includes: Gauss Seidel, Jacobian Sequential, Jacobian Parallel with p-cores, uniform subsampling linear regression, leveraging weighted subsampling linear regression, and elastic net with ratio parameter alpha.

Problem Setting
For linear system:

Ax = b A in dim(n,p) x in dim(p,1) b in dim(n,1)

we are interested in solving the parameter x based on A and b interatively, that is, starting by an initial guess of solution x, which usually set to be zero vector of p-length, constructing an iterative formula to estimate the solution in each based on the soluiton generated by previous step. Algorithm model will lie closer and closer to the true value of solution as the number of iteration increase, usually, for general problems in high-dimensional data set, after tens of thousands permutations, estimated solutions almost get to true solution.

Function Description
solve_ols
solve_ols(A,b,x0,func, core)
function in the package contains three popular algorithms : Guass seidel, Jacobian sequential and Jacobian parallel, which can be called by define specific input for 'func'. chosen from func = 'Gauss', 'Jacobiseq','Jacobipar'.

With a problem set to be solved Ax = b, solve x iteratively by starting at initial guess x0 = zero vector, iteration number in function is pre-defined as 10000 times. For jacobian parallel function, need to input value p, number of cores to distribute data row wise. Gauss seidel and jacobian parallel can deal with rectangle matrix. User cna test functions with his own matrix data, for convenience, use the data stimulated in data.stimualted.R file, Example of using solve_ols()

beta = solve_ols(A_2,b_2,x0, func = 'Gauss') beta = solve_ols(A_2,b_2,x0, func = 'Jacobiseq') beta = solve_ols(A_2,b_2,x0, func = 'Jacobipar',p = 4) beta = solve_ols(A_4,b_4,x_4, func = 'Gauss') beta = solve_ols(A_4,b_4,x_4, func = 'Jacobipar',p = 1)

Able to compare estimation performance of different algorithms

algo_leverage
algo_leverage <- function(x,y,method,n)
algo_leverage function is a function to perform linear regression on uniform subsampling and leverage weighted subsampling. By subsampling method 'uniform' or 'leverage' , and size of subset n defined by input, function will choose a subset of n size from whole data by row, using uniform probability or leverging weight . Then, inplement ordinary linear regression and weighted linear regression on data. Able to compare the estimation accuracy of these tow methods. Example of using algo_leverage() using data in data.stimulation.R,both x and y are 1-dimensional vectors:

beta = algo_leverage(x,y,'leverage',20) beta = algo_leverage(x,y,'uniform',20) beta = algo_leverage(x,y,'leverage',50) beta = algo_leverage(x,y,'uniform',50)

elnet_coord
elnet_coord <- function(x,y, alpha)
elnet_coord is an algorithm to perform elastic net coordinate descent. Elastic Net algorithm is an improvement of Lasso and Ridge regression by control the ratio of l1 and l2 norm panelty by parameter alpha, between 0-1.In this function, max iteration number of pre-defined to be 1000, all estimate beta at each step is stored but will return the last estimate of beta. Using data in data_stimulation.R, example to use elnet_coord() both on small matrix and large matrix:

beta = elnet_coord(A_4,b_4,0.5) beta = elnet_coord(A_4,b_4,01) beta = elnet_coord(A_2,b_2,0.5) beta = elnet_coord(A_2,b_2,1)
